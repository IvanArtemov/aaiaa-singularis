      "8: Methods 35 healthy controls and 47 volunteer COPD patients underwent bronchoscopy with  bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and sampling by endobronchial biopsies in 2014–2015  as part of the MicroCOPD Study.\n",
      "9: Biopsies were embedded in glycol methyl acrylate  (GMA) resin and examined by immunohistochemistry and staining for enumeration of  CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + , CD20 + , CD68 + , EG2 + , and NE+ inflammatory cells, as well  as endothelial cells (EN4) and smooth muscle actin (SMA).\n",
      "10: Mucus cells were stained  by periodic acid-schiff (PAS), and toluidine blue to visualize the reticular basement  membrane (RBM).\n",
      "11: Results The numbers of macrophages and eosinophils were higher, and vascularity  increased in the submucosa in COPD patients compared with healthy controls.\n",
      "12: In  healthy smokers there were lower numbers of lymphocytes (CD3 +, CD4 +, CD8 +,  CD20+) than never smokers.\n",
      "13: However, COPD patients with GOLD I/II had higher  numbers of eosinophils and larger smooth muscle area compared with GOLD III/IV.\n",
      "14: COPD exacerbations the last year, blood eosinophils, and use of inhaled corticoste­ roids did not affect levels of inflammation or remodeling.\n",
      "15: PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326267  June 17, 2025 2 / 12 Conclusion Smoking alters inflammation in healthy controls, while specific patterns of macro­ phages, eosinophils, and vascularity distinguish COPD from non-COPD in bronchial  biopsies.\n",
      "16: Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory condition  characterized by fixed airflow obstruction.\n",
      "17: The disease is highly heterogeneous, with  considerable variation among patients in manifestations such as emphysema and  chronic bronchitis\n",
      "18: [1].\n",
      "19: While some COPD patients experience frequent exacerbations  [2], often triggered by infections [3], others have none.\n",
      "20: The primary cause of COPD is prolonged exposure to inhaled noxious agents,  most often tobacco smoke.\n",
      "21: However, the exact pathogenesis remains unclear.\n",
      "22: Fixed  airflow obstruction results from a combination of small airway collapse due to the loss  of elastic support tissue and emphysema, as well as airway inflammation leading to  edema and narrowing of the lumen.\n",
      "23: Despite this, anti-inflammatory therapies such  as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have shown limited effectiveness in COPD patients  [4,5].\n",
      "24: This has changed recently to some degree with the realization that COPD  patients with higher blood eosinophil counts may benefit from ICS\n",
      "25: [6,7].\n",
      "26: In asthma, both inflammation and airway remodeling are well-established phenom­ ena\n",
      "27: [8], with substantial evidence supporting the effectiveness of ICS.\n",
      "28: However, in  COPD, fewer studies have examined inflammatory cells in bronchial biopsies com­ pared to healthy controls [9–17].\n",
      "29: Across nine key studies, only 205 COPD patients  and 213 non-COPD have been included, often with differences in age matching\n",
      "30: [9–11,13,17], methodologies, and handling of ICS use.\n",
      "31: Few studies have been pow­ ered to look at COPD subgroups, although some studies have specifically addressed  the important question of the impact of ICSs [17–20].\n",
      "32: Only three studies have  attempted to examine differences in COPD characteristics, such as GOLD stage [14],  chronic bronchitis\n",
      "33: [21] and exacerbation frequency\n",
      "34: [22].\n",
      "35: Evidence on airway remodeling in COPD is even more limited.\n",
      "36: Only three studies  have compared the reticular basement membrane (RBM) thickness\n",
      "37: [22–24], two  have compared smooth muscle area\n",
      "38: [25,26], two have examined goblet cell density  [22,27], and two have compared degree of vascularity [24,28].\n",
      "39: Furthermore, the  effect of smoking in subjects without known lung disease is underexplored, where  only four previous studies have specifically compared healthy smokers with healthy  never smokers [10,11,15,16].\n",
      "40: Overall, there is a significant gap in understanding histopathological changes in  medium to large airways in COPD, particularly regarding remodeling and its relation­ ship with local inflammation.\n",
      "41: Differences among COPD subgroups and the effects of  smoking on bronchial inflammation in healthy individuals are also poorly understood.\n",
      "42: Here, we present data from the largest bronchoscopy study to date involving  both COPD patients and healthy volunteers.\n",

      "46: The study  aimed to compare airway inflammation and remodeling between COPD patients and healthy controls, explore differences  within COPD subgroups, and assess the effects of smoking among healthy adults categorized as current, former, or  never-smokers.\n",
      "47: Methods Study population\n",
      "48: The study population is a subsample from the MicroCOPD Study.\n",
      "49: Briefly, the MicroCOPD study included 130 COPD  patients and 103 healthy controls from Western Norway, with bronchoscopy performed to sample the lower airway micro­ biome.\n",
      "50: Data collection started 11th of Aril 2014 and was concluded 5th of June 2015 at the outpatient clinic of the Depart­ ment of Thoracic Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.\n",
      "51: The study was approved by the regional  ethical committee (REK Vest case # 2011/1307), all participants provided written consent, and the study was conducted in  accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n",
      "52: All subjects were examined by a study physician and a detailed medical history including smoking habits, medications,  comorbidities, respiratory symptoms, and COPD exacerbations was obtained.\n",
      "53: Spirometry was performed after inhalation  of 0.4 mg salbutamol prior to the bronchoscopy, and the details of the bronchoscopic sampling procedure have been pub­ lished [29].\n",
      "54: Bronchoscopy was performed with oral access while the patient was supine, under local lidocaine anesthesia  and optional intravenous alfentanil.\n",
      "55: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was collected from the middle lobe, and sterile brushes  were used to sample both lungs.\n",
      "56: Beginning April 28th, 2014, bronchial biopsies were also collected during bronchoscopy  using 1.8 mm disposable cupped forceps (Olympus).\n",
      "57: Three medium-large biopsies were sampled from the fourth to sec­ ond carina of the right lower lobe, with 5 mL of 0.1 mg/mL adrenaline instilled prior to sampling to minimize bleeding.\n",
      "58: Due  to staffing limitations, biopsies were processed intermittently.\n",
      "59: This study includes 35 lung-healthy controls and 47 COPD  patients with acceptable biopsy specimens for immunohistochemistry.\n",
      "60: Immunohistochemistry Biopsies were fixed in acetone, embedded in GMA, and sectioned at 2 µm thickness, as described by Britten et al.\n",
      "61: [30].\n",
      "62: Only participants with biopsies containing at least 0.49 mm² submucosal area were included [31].\n",
      "63: Immunohistochemistry  targeted endothelial cells (EN4), smooth muscle actin (SMA), and inflammatory cells: neutrophils (NE), T-cells (CD3, CD4,  CD8), B-cells (CD20), macrophages (CD68), and eosinophils (EG2), following the protocol by Collins et al.\n",
      "64: [32].\n",
      "65: For measurements of mucus in the epithelium, only participants whose biopsies revealed intact epithelium not tan­ gentially cut, and whose total length was a minimum of 0.1 mm were included [31].\n",
      "66: One 2 µm thin section per biopsy was  stained with periodic acid-schiff (PAS), and the same cutting procedure and inclusion criteria were used to stain sections  with toluidine blue to measure the thickness of the lamina reticularis (RBM).\n",
      "67: Biopsy sections from one participant per experiment were used as negative controls, and sections from nasal polyps  and tonsils were used as positive controls.\n",
      "68: All sections were converted to digital images by a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer  XR scanner and Aperio ImageScope (version 12.1) was used for image analyses.\n",
      "69: Image analysis T-cells, B-cells, macrophages, and eosinophils were manually counted and reported as positive cells/mm² of submucosa,  excluding muscle and vessels.\n",
      "70: Neutrophils and epithelial mucus fraction were measured using a positive pixel count algo­ rithm.\n",
      "71: The thickness of the lamina reticularis was measured as the total area of lamina reticularis/ length of µm epithelium  beneath.\n",
      "72: Muscle fraction was calculated as SMA stained area/mm2 in the submucosa and vascularity was calculated as  area fraction of EN4 stained cells/mm2 in the submucosa.\n",

      "74: All histochemistry experiments and image analyses were performed by the same technician,  blinded to participant diagnosis.\n",
      "75: Statistical analysis The statistical analyses were performed with Stata 14.2 and Prism 10.4.\n",
      "76: A post-hoc power analysis of the examined asso­ ciations between inflammatory cells and remodeling indices was performed with the program G power\n",
      "77: [33].\n",
      "78: Most indices  examined showed non-normal distributions.\n",
      "79: Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to compare distributions and Kruskal-­ Wallis tests to compare medians within groups and subgroups.\n",
      "80: All pairwise correlation coefficients between the inflamma­ tion and remodeling variables were calculated by Spearman’s nonparametric rank correlation tests.\n",
      "81: P values < 0.05 were  considered statistically significant.\n",
      "82: Results The characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1.\n",
      "83: Sex and age were comparable between lung-healthy  controls and COPD patients.\n",
      "84: However, smoking status differed significantly, as only controls included never smokers.\n",
      "85: Slightly more than one-third of the COPD patients had an FEV1 < 50% of the predicted value, and more than half used  inhaled corticosteroids (Table 1).\n",
      "86: The correlations between the inflammatory cells and indices of remodeling in the bronchial biopsies are shown in  Tables 2 and 3, for controls and COPD patients respectively.\n",
      "87: The numbers represent the Spearman´s nonparametric correlation coefficients, and only statistically significant cor­ relations are shown.\n",
      "88: In the control group we detected a positive correlation between lymphocytes and macrophages,  and between lymphocytes and area fraction of microvessels.\n",
      "89: In contrast, in the COPD group we found more correla­ tions between nearly all the inflammatory cell types, and between the inflammatory cells and microvessel area fraction.\n",
      "90: Especially macrophages in COPD patients correlated significantly with nearly all the tested markers of inflammation and  remodeling, besides the muscle area fraction (Table 3) .\n",
      "91: The 11 measures of inflammation and remodeling in the bronchial biopsies are depicted in Fig 2.\n",
      "92: The graphs both show comparisons between healthy controls and all COPD patients and COPD patients in GOLD  stages I/II and GOLD III/IV, as well as comparisons among the COPD patients of the COPD stages, exacerbations in  the previous year, blood eosinophils ≥0.3 * 10^9/L, and use of ICS.\n",
      "93: Compared with healthy controls, COPD patients had  more macrophages and eosinophils, as well as larger areas of microvessels in the submucosa.\n",
      "94: This was driven entirely by  COPD patients with GOLD stages I/II.\n",

      "180: [9].\n",
      "181: Loss of  lung tissue is an established part of the pathophysiology in COPD, where chronic inflammation, a proteases-­antiprotease  imbalance, and oxidative stress have been implicated in apoptosis and necrosis [40,41].\n",
      "182: In addition, with altered signal­ ing or stem cell depletion impaired tissue repair may be a factor.\n",
      "183: In more advanced disease there is a larger loss of lung  tissue, which may help explain the finding in our study of a smaller smooth muscle area in biopsies from GOLD III/IV  patients compared with GOLD I/II.\n",
      "184: Although not statistically significant, COPD patients with one or more COPD exacerbations the last year had higher  numbers of neutrophils, macrophages, and mucus cells in their biopsies, as one could expect as signs of a persistent  immune responses to bacteria.\n",
      "185: Exacerbations within one year is a very crude measurement, as some exacerbations may  be 11 months prior to the study, other 4 months, and the time effects are likely to differ.\n",
      "186: COPD exacerbations are known to  lead to worse prognosis [42] and faster lung function decline [43].\n",
      "187: Although not significant, the cellular trend in our biop­ sies may be worthwhile to explore further in future studies, as a larger study may provide evidence for persistent inflam­ mation induced by COPD exacerbations.\n",
      "188: There are some methodological issues to discuss.\n",
      "189: First, the post-hoc power analyses confirmed that our sample size  was too low to provide the necessary power for several associations examined, thus there is a chance of type II errors.\n",
      "190: Power will vary by the association in question, and was adequate for comparing blood and BAL findings, and number of  macrophages in the biopsies for instance, but based on our findings we would suggest an ideal sample size would consist  of 100 subjects in each study arm to account for sub-group analyses as well.\n",
      "191: In an interesting analyses of biopsies from  51 COPD patients sampled twice 10 weeks apart, a sample size of more than 30 would be necessary in each group  to reliably predict a doubling or halving of the number of CD8 + cells [44].\n",
      "192: Analyses on change is different from cross-­ sectional data, but the study serves as a reminder that most previous studies are possibly underpowered, at least for sub­ group analyses.\n",
      "193: Second, our study is cross-sectional and can therefore not assess whether inflammation is a precursor  or effect of COPD, and therefore also not mechanisms by which inflammation potentially would lead to COPD, or specific  COPD phenotypes.\n",
      "194: Third, bronchial biopsies were taken from the 4–6 carinae in the right lower lobe, which may not be  PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326267  June 17, 2025 10 / 12 representative of the smaller airways.\n",
      "195: COPD has significant disease related to the small airways and alveoli, and the  effect and/or presence of inflammation in the smaller airways could be different from what we see in the somewhat larger  airways.\n",
      "196: Despite uncertainties, our study supports an overall trend; increased macrophages and CD8 + lymphocytes in COPD  submucosa, with neutrophils more prominent in BAL fluid.\n",
      "197: Eosinophils may also be increased.\n",
      "198: The increase in immune  cells is more evident in mild-to-moderate COPD, possibly due to disease-stage differences, ICS effects, or overall cellu­ lar decline in advanced disease.\n",
      "199: Increased microvascularity may indicate enhanced leukocyte transport or adaptation to  chronic hypoxia.\n",
      "200: To better understand the drivers of airway inflammation and remodeling in COPD, integrating bronchial biopsy findings  with microbiome data is crucial.\n",
      "201: Immune responses are closely tied to microbial dysbiosis, which may influence disease  progression and heterogeneity.\n",
      "202: Longitudinal studies with larger, well-characterized cohorts are needed to clarify the inter­ play between inflammation, remodeling, and clinical phenotypes.\n",
      "203: This study highlights increased vascularity and higher numbers of macrophages and eosinophils in COPD bronchial  submucosa compared to controls.\n",
      "204: Smoking exerted a suppressive effect on lymphocyte numbers, while advanced COPD  was associated with reduced smooth muscle area.\n",
      "205: Despite methodological challenges and sample size limitations, our  findings contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting nuanced and evolving inflammatory and remodeling profiles  in COPD.\n",
